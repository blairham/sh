//
// It returns an exit status. Writing to r.Stdout and r.Stderr rather than to
// the process's own streams is what makes it work inside a pipeline and under
// a redirection, because those are what the runner points at the right place.
//
// args are the operands, without the name the command was called by. `greet a
// b` gives {"a", "b"} and not {"greet", "a", "b"} — the same shape the
// builtins in this package are written against, where args[0] is the first
// thing after the name. Said here because guessing it the other way costs a
// silently dropped argument rather than a compile error.

// Register adds a builtin, replacing any of the same name.
//
// This is one of the two ways to build a shell on this package, and the line
// between them is worth stating because most of a dialect belongs on the
// other side of it.
//
// Register what cannot be written in shell: commands that must reach the
// interpreter's own state or the operating system. `cd` has to change the
// working directory the runner uses, `read` has to put a value into a
// variable of the calling shell, `local` has to create a scope, `trap` has to
// install a handler. None of those can be expressed as a shell function
// because a shell function has no way to say them.
//
// Everything else is better as a **shell function**, sourced as a prelude and
// needing no Go at all. Functions already shadow builtins and external
// commands alike, so a dialect layer can define, replace or wrap anything
// this package provides without touching it:
//
//	basename() { printf '%s\n' "${1##*/}"; }
//	echo()     { printf '%s\n' "$*"; }   # replaces the builtin

// break the substrate. Reach for Go when shell genuinely cannot express the
// thing, and not before.
