		Why:     "the base case: an unquoted parameter expansion is split",
	},
	{
		ID: "split/quoted-param", Category: "field splitting",
		Snippet: `x="a b"; set -- "$x"; printf "[%s]" "$@"`,
		Why:     "quoting suppresses splitting; without this the base case proves nothing",
	},
	{
		ID: "split/cmdsub-unquoted", Category: "field splitting",
		Snippet: `set -- $(printf "a b"); echo "n=$#"`,
		Why:     "zsh does not split parameter expansions but does split this — the axis is narrower than 'word splitting'",
	},
	{
		ID: "split/param-braced", Category: "field splitting",
		Snippet: `x="a b"; set -- ${x}; echo "n=$#"`,
		Why:     "braces are not quoting; ${x} splits wherever $x does",
	},

		ID: "split/empty-value", Category: "field splitting",
		Snippet: `x=""; set -- $x; echo "n=$#"`,
		Why:     "an unquoted empty expansion produces no field at all",
	},
	{
		ID: "split/empty-value-quoted", Category: "field splitting",
		Snippet: `x=""; set -- "$x"; echo "n=$#"`,
		Why:     "quoted, the same value produces one empty field — the pair is the point",
	},

		ID: "split/unset-value", Category: "field splitting",
		Snippet: `unset u; set -- $u; echo "n=$#"`,
		Why:     "unset behaves as empty here, rather than as an error",

	// --- field splitting: IFS mechanics --------------------------------
	{
		ID: "ifs/default-runs-collapse", Category: "IFS",
		Snippet: `x="a b   c"; set -- $x; printf "[%s]" "$@"`,
		Why:     "a run of IFS whitespace is one delimiter",
	},
	{
		ID: "ifs/default-edges-stripped", Category: "IFS",
		Snippet: `x="  a  b  "; set -- $x; printf "[%s]" "$@"`,
		Why:     "leading and trailing IFS whitespace is discarded entirely",
	},
	{
		ID: "ifs/nonws-separates", Category: "IFS",
		Snippet: `IFS=:; x="a:b:c"; set -- $x; printf "[%s]" "$@"`,

	{

		Snippet: `set -- "a b" c; printf "[%s]" "$@"`,

		Snippet: `set -- a b; printf "[%s]" "$*"`,
		Why:     `"$*" joins into a single field`,

		ID: "params/star-joins-with-ifs", Category: "special parameters",
		Snippet: `set -- a b; IFS=:; printf "[%s]" "$*"`,

	},
	{
		ID: "params/at-empty-is-zero-fields", Category: "special parameters",
		Snippet: `set --; set -- "$@"; echo "n=$#"`,

		Snippet: `set --; set -- "$*"; echo "n=$#"`,
		Why:     `"$*" yields one empty field instead — why set -- "$*" is not safe`,

	{

		Snippet: `cd /; x="et*"; set -- "$x"; printf "[%s]" "$@"`,

		Snippet: `cd /; set -- et*; printf "[%s]" "$@"`,
		Why:     "a literal pattern is matched even in zsh — separating that from expansion results",

		Snippet: `echo {1..3}`,
		Why:     "brace expansion is absent from dash",
	},
	{
		ID: "expand/brace-before-param", Category: "expansion",
		Snippet: `a=1; echo {$a,2}`,
		Why:     "braces resolve before parameter expansion, so variable ranges cannot work",
	},
	{
		ID: "expand/tilde-unquoted", Category: "expansion",
		Snippet: `case $(echo ~) in /*) echo abs;; *) echo literal;; esac`,
		Why:     "an unquoted leading tilde expands",

	// --- semantics axes --------------------------------------------------
	{
		ID: "axis/array-base", Category: "semantics axes",
		Snippet: `a=(x y); echo "${a[1]}"`,
		Why:     "zsh indexes arrays from 1; dash has no arrays at all",

		ID: "axis/echo-backslash", Category: "semantics axes",
		Snippet: `if [ "$(echo 'a\tb')" = 'a\tb' ]; then echo literal; else echo expanded; fi`,

	},
	{
		ID: "axis/pipeline-last-element", Category: "semantics axes",
		Snippet: `echo x | read v; echo "[$v]"`,
		Why:     "ksh and zsh run the last pipeline element in the current shell; dash and bash use a subshell",
	},

		Snippet: `f() { local v=1; echo "$v"; }; f`,
		Why:     "ksh93 is the only panel member without local, which is why it is not a compatibility target",
