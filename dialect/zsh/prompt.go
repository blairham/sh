//
// zsh does *not* expand the value. `PS1='<$LOGNAME>@ '` draws `$LOGNAME` as
// it stands, and it takes `setopt PROMPT_SUBST` to change that.
//
// It has its own language instead, spelled with a percent sign — `%n` for the
// user name, `%~` for the directory — which is a separate question and is not
// settled here.
//
// Measured through a pty rather than taken from documentation: the panel
// disagrees about this, and the disagreement is why the field exists.
