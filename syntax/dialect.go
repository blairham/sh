// Dialect says which constructs the lexer accepts.
//
// Fields are named for the construct rather than for the shell that wants it,
// which docs/spec/semantics.md requires and which the measurements insist on:
// ksh93 accepts `&>` or does not depending on which build is installed, twelve
// years apart under the same name, so a field called `Ksh` could not be given
// a value. A field called [Dialect.AmpersandRedirect] can.
//
// Grammar differences are additive — a construct either parses or it does not
// — which is why this is a set of flags. Semantic differences, where the same
// syntax means different things, are not additive and do not belong here; they
// are the interpreter's problem and get their own vector.
type Dialect struct {
	// AmpersandRedirect enables `&>` and `&>>`, which redirect both streams.
	//
	// This is the one to be careful with. Where it is off, `echo hi &>b` is
	// not an error: it is `echo hi &` — a background command — followed by
	// `>b`, which truncates the file. The command runs, its output goes
	// elsewhere, and nothing is reported. Accepting the union of dialects
	// here would silently pick one meaning for text that legitimately has
	// two.
	AmpersandRedirect bool

	// CaseFallthrough enables `;&`, which runs the next case body. Absent
	// from dash, and from bash before 4.0 — so it cannot be reached through
	// macOS's /bin/sh.
	CaseFallthrough bool

	// CStyleFor enables `for ((init; cond; post))`. Absent from dash, where
	// the parenthesis after `for` is a syntax error.
	CStyleFor bool

	// Select enables `select name [in words] do … done`, the menu loop.
	// Absent from dash, where `select` is an ordinary word and the `do` that
	// follows it is a syntax error.
	Select bool

	// AppendAssign enables `name+=value`, which appends rather than
	// replacing. Absent from dash, where `x+=b` is a command called `x+=b`.
	AppendAssign bool

	// CasePatternAcceptsOperator lets an operator stand where a case pattern
	// belongs, which produces an arm with no patterns at all.
	//
	// Measured rather than inferred from the error it causes, because the
	// error is not the whole of it: `case a in & ) echo hit;; *) echo miss;;
	// esac` *parses and runs* in dash, and prints miss — the `&` is consumed
	// and the arm it opens matches nothing, not even `&` and not even the
	// empty string. `&a )` then fails at the word and `a& )` at the `&`, so
	// what dash accepts is one operator where the pattern list would start
	// and nothing else.
	//
	// The other three reject it outright, which is why `;;&` in a dialect
	// without that terminator reaches a different diagnosis there: dash is
	// already past the `&` and complaining about the `esac` where the `)`
	// should be.
	CasePatternAcceptsOperator bool

	// FuncDefAtParen commits to a function definition as soon as a name is
	// followed by `(`, rather than requiring the `()` pair.
	//
	// It decides *which token* a malformed one is blamed on, which is why it
	// is a grammar flag and not a wording: `f ( x )` is "x" in bash and dash,
	// which are already inside a definition looking for `)`, and "(" in
	// ksh93, which never entered one. Reached most often through a construct
	// a dialect does not have — `[[ ( -n x ) ]]` is a definition of a
	// function called `[[` to a shell without `[[`.
	FuncDefAtParen bool

	// TimesIsReserved makes `times` a reserved word rather than a builtin,
	// so a word after it is a syntax error rather than an argument it
	// ignores. ksh93 alone, and the only place in the panel where *which*
	// builtin a shell has changes what parses.
	TimesIsReserved bool

	// CaseContinue enables `;;&`, which keeps testing later patterns. bash
	// only: ksh93 and zsh both reject it, so it is not core.
	CaseContinue bool

	// DollarSingleQuote enables `$'...'`, where backslash escapes are
	// interpreted. Absent from dash.
	DollarSingleQuote bool

	// Herestring enables `<<<`. Absent from dash.
	Herestring bool

	// ArithCommand enables `(( expr ))` as a command. Consumed by the lexer,
	// which scans the expression as raw text: what is inside is an arithmetic
	// expression rather than a command list, so the token stream would lose
	// it. Where this is off, `(( 1+1 ))` is two nested subshells running
	// `1+1` as a command name, which is what dash does — not an error, a
	// different program.
	ArithCommand bool

	// FunctionKeyword enables `function name { ... }`. Absent from dash,
	// present in bash, ksh93 and zsh.
	FunctionKeyword bool

	// FunctionKeywordParens enables the hybrid `function name() { ... }`.
	// bash and zsh accept it; ksh93 — where the keyword originated — rejects
	// it, so it is not core.
	//
	// It is a second flag rather than part of FunctionKeyword because the
	// two forms are accepted by different sets of shells, and a flag that
	// answers for both cannot be given a value for ksh93. The distinction
	// was documented on FunctionKeyword before anything enforced it, which
	// is how ksh93 came to accept a form it rejects.
	FunctionKeywordParens bool

	// ParamSubstitution enables `${x/pat/rep}` and its anchored forms.
	// Absent from dash.
	ParamSubstitution bool

	// ParamSubstring enables `${x:off:len}`. Absent from dash.
	ParamSubstring bool

	// ParamCaseChange enables `${x^^}` and `${x,,}`. **bash alone**: ksh93
	// reports a syntax error and zsh a bad substitution, so a construct one
	// panel shell supports is not a common denominator and this is off for
	// the core.
	ParamCaseChange bool

	// ParamIndirection enables `${!x}` to *parse*. bash and ksh93 accept it;
	// dash and zsh reject it outright.
	//
	// What it then means is not this file's question, and separating the two
	// is what finally made the construct expressible. It is the panel's
	// clearest three-way divergence — bash indirects, ksh93 yields the name,
	// dash and zsh error — and a single flag could not carry three answers.
	// Split into "does it parse" here and "what does it mean" in the
	// semantics vector, each half is binary. That is the grammar/semantics
	// split doing the work it was introduced for, on the case that motivated
	// it.
	ParamIndirection bool

	// ArithIncDec enables `++` and `--`. Not POSIX; dash rejects them.
	ArithIncDec bool

	// ArithComma enables the sequence operator. Not POSIX; dash rejects it.
	ArithComma bool

	// ArithExplicitBase enables the `base#digits` form. Absent from dash.
	ArithExplicitBase bool

	// ArithLeadingZeroIsOctal decides whether `0100` is sixty-four or one
	// hundred. It is true everywhere but zsh, and it is the quietest
	// divergence measured: nothing warns, both answers are plausible
	// numbers, and file modes are written with leading zeros.
	//
	// Nothing in the parser reads this — a literal is kept as written, so
	// the tree does not bake in an answer — but the field belongs with the
	// others, and evaluation needs it.
	ArithLeadingZeroIsOctal bool

	// ArithFloat enables floating point, which ksh93 and zsh have and POSIX
	// does not.
	ArithFloat bool

	// ExtendedPattern enables `@(a|b)`, `?(a)`, `+(a)`, `*(a)` and `!(a)` in
	// a pattern: a group with a quantifier in front of it. ksh93 has them
	// wherever a pattern may stand.
	ExtendedPattern bool

	// ExtendedPatternInCondition enables the same groups inside `[[ ]]` and
	// nowhere else, which is bash's answer: `[[ abc == @(abc|xyz) ]]` matches
	// there while `case abc in @(abc|xyz))` is a syntax error, because bash
	// reads the condition's operand under rules a `case` pattern does not
	// get. ksh93 answers yes to this as well as to the field above; a shell
	// with neither leaves both false.
	ExtendedPatternInCondition bool

	// PatternAlternation enables a bare `(a|b)` inside a pattern word, which
	// zsh has and the others do not: `a(b|c)` matches `ab` there. It is why
	// `@(abc|xyz)` is a literal `@` followed by a group in zsh rather than an
	// extended pattern — the same text, read by a different rule.
	PatternAlternation bool

	// ArrayLiteral enables `a=(x y)`. Absent from dash, where the `(` is a
	// syntax error rather than a different construct — so unlike `&>`, this
	// one is safe to be wrong about loudly.
	ArrayLiteral bool

	// CloseBraceAlwaysReserved makes `}` a reserved word wherever a word may
	// stand, not only where a command may begin.
	//
	// It is what lets zsh write `{ echo hi }` with no terminator before the
	// brace: the `}` cannot be an argument, so it can only be closing the
	// group. The same rule is why `echo }` is a syntax error there and prints
	// a brace in the other three, which is the half that shows it is one rule
	// rather than a special case inside brace groups.
	CloseBraceAlwaysReserved bool

	// ArraySubscript enables `${a[i]}`, `${a[@]}` and `${a[*]}`. Absent from
	// dash, which has no arrays at all and calls the subscript a bad
	// substitution rather than reading it — a separate flag from
	// ArrayLiteral because the two halves are separately reachable: a
	// subscript can be written for a variable that was never an array.
	ArraySubscript bool

	// DoubleBracket enables `[[ ... ]]`.
	//
	// Consumed by the *parser*, not the lexer, and the reason is worth
	// stating because the opposite is the obvious guess. Inside `[[ ]]` the
	// `<` and `>` are comparisons rather than redirections, which sounds like
	// a lexer mode — but `[[` is only special in command position (`echo [[ a
	// ]]` prints `[[ a ]]`), and the lexer does not know where commands
	// begin. Lexing `<` as an operator loses nothing: the parser knows it is
	// inside `[[ ]]` and reinterprets the token. A lexer mode keyed on seeing
	// the word `[[` would break `echo`.
	DoubleBracket bool
}

// Core is the common denominator of real shells: what dash, bash, ksh93 and
// zsh agree on, minus dash, whose absence is the decision recorded in
// docs/spec/core.md.
//
// CaseContinue is off because it is bash-only. Everything else here is
// something every non-dash shell in the reference panel accepts.
