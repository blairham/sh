# User research: what people hate about their shells

Web sweep, 2026-08-14 — the complaints that drive shell switching, mapped
against the shell. This document exists so the roadmap is driven by real pain,
not vibes. The answers land under the out-of-box-experience milestone.

## The complaint → answer map

| # | Complaint (who bleeds users) | Evidence | the shell answer | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Slow startup** — oh-my-zsh 500ms–5s; the top zsh→fish driver | HN threads, fish 4.0 marketing (<100ms) | static binary, lazy plugins, async segments — but make it a *guarantee* | <30ms CI-enforced startup budget |
| 2 | **Bad defaults** — zsh needs a manual + plugin manager before it's pleasant; fish wins on out-of-box highlighting/autosuggestions/git prompt | every zsh-vs-fish comparison | theme ✓ prompt ✓ completion ✓ git ✓ — missing the two fish signatures | syntax highlighting and autosuggestions |
| 3 | **Breaking POSIX breaks tools** — fish/nushell as login shell → silent tool failures, scripts don't run, years of muscle memory lost | shell-env issue 20, nushell threads | *the founding bet*: bash-compatible core, zsh plugins via zi | the login/non-interactive contract, pinned by the compat suite |
| 4 | **History lost across tabs/sessions** — bash keeps only the first shell's; zsh needs incantations; atuin's popularity is the demand signal | ohmyzsh issue 9430, atuin coverage | JSONL store already shared on disk | live reload in concurrent sessions |
| 5 | **Unhelpful errors** — "command not found", nothing more | ubiquitous | we own the exec seam | typo suggestions + install hints; the explain-error surface |
| 6 | **Config complexity** — oh-my-zsh sprawl, plugin-manager fatigue | manjaro/dev.to threads | zero-config defaults + zi built in (no bootstrap) + one rc file | in place |
| 7 | **Quoting/word-splitting footguns, ugly syntax** | HN perennials | inherited deliberately (compat > purity); shellcheck-grade diagnostics at the prompt (we hold a real parse tree); plus red-unknown-commands highlighting and explain | footgun diagnostics at the prompt |
| 8 | **Windows second-class** | nushell's win there | native interactive port planned; ConPTY groundwork in the term boundary; WSL2 supported today | sequenced to v1.x |

## The positioning sentence this research supports
