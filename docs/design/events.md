Split out of the agent work as its own
idea: plugins that react to what happens in a session — `cd` into a repo
and get the toolchain setup suggested, a lockfile changes and the install
command is offered, a command fails twice and `explain` is proposed.

**Status: contract defined, host not wired.** `proto/sh/plugin/v1/events.proto`
exists and `CAPABILITY_EVENTS` is allocated; nothing subscribes yet. That
ordering is deliberate and matches how the rest of this package was
built — the shape of a plugin contract is far harder to change once
plugins exist than before, so the contract is designed first and the
internals grow around it.

## Why this is the dangerous one

Every other tier-2 service answers a question the shell asked.
`CompletionProvider` is asked for candidates; `EnvProvider` is asked for
a diff; `ThemeProvider` is asked for a prompt. The host is in control of
when, and a plugin that misbehaves costs its own feature.

ShellEvents inverts that: the plugin is *told* things and gets to speak
unprompted. That is what makes it useful, and it is exactly why the
constraints below are not negotiable. A hook system is how shells
historically became slow and unpredictable — the reason the shell notices
directory changes natively instead of asking users to `eval "$(... hook
bash)"` is that hooks bolted onto a prompt are a performance and
correctness hazard.

## The three rules

### 1. No exec channel, ever

A plugin proposes; the shell decides. This is the same line
drawn for the agent
builtin — **the shell hosts other people's agents rather than being one** —
and it is precisely why orchestration cannot move behind the plugin
boundary without weakening the invariant.

`Proposal` has no field that causes execution. `suggested_command` lands
in the editor buffer for the user to read and edit — the same
preview-before-execute posture as the AI surface — and
the host owns quoting: a suggestion is *data*, never buffer text. That
closes the "a completion became code execution" class of bug for this
service too.

The `rationale` field is required by convention rather than by the
protocol, for a human reason: a suggestion nobody can evaluate gets
either blindly accepted or permanently ignored, and both are bad.

### 2. The host never blocks on a subscriber

Events are fire-and-forget into a bounded buffer, drop-oldest. A plugin
that stops reading loses events; it never slows the prompt.

This forced the RPC shape. In go-plugin the **host is the gRPC client**
and the plugin is the server, so a host→plugin push needs the host
sending on a stream. And a proposal arrives when a plugin is ready, not
as a reply to one event. So:

```proto
rpc Subscribe(stream ShellEvent) returns (stream Proposal);
```

Bidirectional. A request/response RPC per event would have made the host
wait on a plugin for every `cd`, which rule 2 forbids outright.

Proposals carry `event_seq`, so one answering a superseded event can be
dropped — a suggestion for the directory you just left is worse than no
suggestion. Same discipline as every other request in this package.

### 3. Events carry allowlisted, scrub-safe data only

An event stream is a new place for a secret to leak, so it is designed
not to carry one.

`EVENT_KIND_COMMAND_DONE` carries the command's **first word** — `git`,
not `git push --force origin main`. The argument list is where tokens,
private paths, and hostnames live, and a plugin reacting to "a git
command failed" does not need them. Environment is the allowlisted
subset, exactly as `EnvDiffRequest` carries it.

This is the posture the history scrubber, the env trust flow and the
AI surface already hold, applied unchanged, and it is cheaper to
hold now than to retrofit: a plugin ecosystem that has learned to expect
full command lines cannot be told later that it can't have them.

## What a v1 would still have to decide

1. **Where subscription is declared.** The proto currently lets a plugin
   send `watch_paths` in a `Proposal`, so it can adjust what it watches
   as it learns where it is. Whether *event kinds* should also be
   declared that way, or in `DescribeResponse`, is open. Describe is
   simpler; in-stream is more flexible; doing both would be worst.
2. **File watching is the expensive part.** `sh-git` already runs an
   fsnotify watcher, so the machinery exists — but a per-plugin watch
   set, with plugins coming and going, is a different problem from one
   watcher for one repo. This is the piece to prototype before
   estimating anything.
3. **Proposal rate limiting.** A plugin that proposes on every event
   turns the prompt into a billboard. Probably a cap per event and a
   dedupe on identical notices, but the honest answer is that this needs
   a real plugin to tune against.
4. **Does a proposal survive the next prompt?** A lockfile-changed
   suggestion is still valid thirty seconds later; a
   command-failed suggestion probably is not. Likely a per-kind
   lifetime, decided when there is something real to observe.

## Prior art worth not repeating

- **zsh's `precmd`/`preexec`**: the reason "my shell got slow" is a
  genre. Anything a plugin does here must be unable to delay the prompt,
  which rule 2 enforces structurally rather than by asking politely.
- **direnv's hook**: a good feature whose install step (`eval "$(direnv
  hook bash)"`) is a permanent tax on every shell start and a source of
  ordering bugs. the shell notices `cd` natively; that is the whole point of
  the EnvProvider design, and ShellEvents should never reintroduce a
  hook install.
- **PowerShell's event subsystem**: rich, and almost nobody uses it —
  a caution that the vocabulary should stay small enough to learn in one
  sitting.
