# Invocation

What the front end decides before anything runs: which route the shell
was invoked by, which operand becomes `$0`, and whether there is a person
at the other end. `driver/` is the whole of it — nothing outside that
directory implements how a shell is invoked.

This file covers the last of those. The rest is in `AGENTS.md` under
"One driver, four dialects" and is not yet written down here.

## Deciding to prompt

**The rule.** A shell prompts when `-i` says so, or when it was given
nothing to run and its standard input **is a terminal**. Anything else is
a script: a redirect from a file or a device, a pipe, a closed
descriptor, a script named as an operand, or `-c`.

**"Is a terminal" is an ioctl, not a mode bit.** Asking for the terminal
attributes — `TIOCGETA` on the BSDs, `TCGETS` on Linux, what
`isatty(3)` is — is the only test that answers the question. Whether the
file is a *character device* is a strictly weaker question, and the null
device passes it.

That is not a hypothetical. `sh < /dev/null` is the canonical cron,
systemd, CI and harness invocation, and the whole point of redirecting
there is that the shell must wait for nobody. Under the mode-bit test it
took the prompt route, the line editor asked the null device for raw
mode, the ioctl answered `ENOTTY`, and the shell exited 2 with
`operation not supported by device`. `/dev/zero`, `/dev/random` and every
other character device were the same. (#509.)

### Measured

Panel: bash 5.3.15, bash 3.2.57, dash, ksh93u+ 2012-08-01, zsh 5.9, on
macOS 25.5 — measured 2026-09-04. "Prompt" means `PS1` reached standard
error; the terminal rows were driven through a pseudo-terminal pair,
which is also how the tests reach the positive case.

No operands, no `-i`:

| standard input | prompt? | what happens instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a terminal | **yes**, all four | the session; `i` is in `$-` |
| `/dev/null` | no, all four | end of input at once, status 0 |
| `/dev/zero` | no, all four | read as a script: bash, dash and zsh read the NUL bytes forever; ksh93 refuses with a syntax error naming the zero byte |
| a regular file | no, all four | read and run as a script |
| a pipe | no, all four | read and run as a script |
| an empty pipe | no, all four | nothing to run, status 0 |
| a closed descriptor | no, all four | dash, ksh93 and zsh exit 0 silently; bash 5.3 fails with `error creating buffered stream: Bad file descriptor` at status 126 |

`/dev/tty` could not be measured: the session doing the measuring has no
controlling terminal to open, which is itself the reason the positive
case needs a pseudo-terminal rather than an inherited one.

With something to run, the terminal stops mattering — unanimously:

| invocation | at a terminal | not at a terminal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sh script.sh` | runs the script, no prompt | runs the script, no prompt |
| `sh -c 'cmd'` | runs the string, no prompt | runs the string, no prompt |

`-s` is the explicit "read standard input" spelling and does not change
the answer: `sh -s` at a terminal prompts and `echo x | sh -s` does not,
exactly as with no operands at all.

### `-i`

`-i` overrides the terminal test in both directions of the panel's
agreement and one direction of its disagreement.

- **With no operands**, all four accept it away from a terminal: they
  print a prompt, read the lines, and say only that job control is off.
  The *editor* is what needs a terminal, and it is the editor that goes
  away — the prompt does not. (ksh93 is inconsistent about drawing the
  prompt itself away from a terminal, printing it on a pipe and not on a
  regular file; it sets the flag either way.)
- **With operands**, the panel splits. All four run the script. dash then
  prompts; bash, ksh93 and zsh exit when the script ends. The core
  follows the three: an operand is work, and work means no prompt.
- **`-i` always puts `i` in `$-`** — in all four, on every route,
  including `-c` and a script operand, and whether or not a prompt is
  ever drawn. Without `-i`, `i` appears only where the shell decided to
  prompt on its own. That the substrate does not yet do this is #472 and
  is not settled here.

### Where it lives

`driver.Interactively` is the decision and is the only place that makes
it, so a dialect binary has a prompt by existing rather than by copying
one. The ioctl behind it is `repl.IsTerminal`, next to the rest of the
termios code, because a second implementation of "is this a terminal" is
how the two answers drift apart.

`interp` asks a related question for `select` and `read -p` and answers
it differently — a character device, excepting the null device — because
`interp` cannot import `repl` and the approximation is documented in
`semantics.md` as a knowing difference. The two are not the same
question: the front end asks about the *invocation*, and a builtin asks
about whatever stream `-u` resolved to.
