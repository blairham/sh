# The command language

How tokens become commands. This consumes what `tokenization.md`
produces and produces what `expansion.md` consumes.

Citation: POSIX.1-2024 XCU §2.9 (shell commands) and §2.10 (grammar).
Panel measurements as in `../oracle.md`.

## The hierarchy

    list        →  and-or  [ ; | & | newline ]  …
    and-or      →  pipeline  [ && | || ]  pipeline  …
    pipeline    →  [ ! ]  command  [ | command ]  …
    command     →  simple | compound | function definition

Each level binds tighter than the one above it. Two consequences are
measured below and are the ones implementations get wrong.

## `&&` and `||` have equal precedence and associate left

This is **not** C's rule, where `&&` binds tighter than `||`. In the
shell they are the same precedence and evaluate left to right:

| probe | all six | why it discriminates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `true \|\| echo A && echo B` | `B` | C's rule would parse `true \|\| (echo A && echo B)`, short-circuit, and print **nothing** |
| `true && echo A \|\| echo B` | `A` | left to right: `A` runs, succeeds, `\|\|` skips |
| `false && echo A \|\| echo B` | `B` | the `&&` fails, so `\|\|` runs |

The first row is the whole test. An implementation that gives `&&` higher
precedence produces no output and is silently wrong on a construct people
write constantly.

## `!` negates the pipeline, not the command

    ! true | false ; echo $?   →  0   in all six

The pipeline's status is `false`'s, which is 1; `!` inverts it to 0. If
`!` bound to `true` alone the answer would be 1. It is a property of the
pipeline, and it appears at most once, at the front.

A pipeline's status is its **last** command's:

    false | true ; echo $?  →  0
    true | false ; echo $?  →  1

## Simple commands

A simple command is any interleaving of three things: variable
assignments, redirections, and words. Only the *first* word is the
command name.

**Redirections are not positional.** They may precede the command name or
sit between its arguments, and they are removed wherever they appear:

    >b echo hi          →  b contains "hi"
    echo one >b two     →  b contains "one two"

Both unanimous. A parser that treats a redirection as a suffix is wrong;
it has to strip them out of the word list wherever they occur.

### Assignment prefixes are transient — except where they are not

    x=1; x=2 true; echo $x   →  1    in all six

The assignment applies to that command's environment only. But POSIX
requires assignments preceding a **special builtin** to persist, and the
panel splits:

| probe | dash | bash | ksh93 | zsh |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `x=1; x=2 export y=3; echo $x` | **2** | 1 | **2** | 1 |

dash and ksh93 follow POSIX; bash and zsh do not outside POSIX mode. The
set of special builtins is fixed and small — `break`, `:`, `continue`,
`.`, `eval`, `exec`, `exit`, `export`, `readonly`, `return`, `set`,
`shift`, `times`, `trap`, `unset` — and it also governs whether a failure
is fatal, so it is one concept with two consequences.

Vector field: `AssignmentPrefixPersistsOnSpecialBuiltin` (default false).

## Grouping: `( )` and `{ }`

`( … )` runs in a subshell; `{ …; }` runs in the current one. The
difference is observable and unanimous:

    x=1; (x=2); echo $x   →  1    state does not escape
    x=1; { x=2; }; echo $x →  2    it does

`{ }` is made of **reserved words**, not operators, so it needs the
surrounding blanks and a terminator before the closing brace. `( )` is
made of operators and needs neither:

| probe | dash | bash | ksh93 | zsh |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `{ echo a; }` | `a` | `a` | `a` | `a` |
| `{ echo a }` | error | error | error | **`a`** |
| `(echo a)` | `a` | `a` | `a` | `a` |

zsh accepts a brace group without the terminator. Vector field:
`BraceGroupNeedsTerminator` (default true).

## Compound commands take redirections

A redirection after a compound command applies to everything inside it:

    { echo a; echo b; } >f            →  f contains a, b
    for i in 1 2; do echo $i; done >f →  f contains 1, 2

Unanimous. The redirection belongs to the compound command as a whole,
which means the AST node for every compound form needs a redirection
list, not just simple commands.

## Loops

`while`, `until` and `for` exit **0 when the body never runs**:

    while false; do :; done; echo $?  →  0
    until true;  do :; done; echo $?  →  0
    for i in;    do echo x; done; echo $?  →  0

Unanimous, and worth pinning because "status of the last command" is the
obvious wrong answer when there was no last command.

## `case`

The core terminator is `;;`. Two extensions exist and they are **not the
same size**:

| terminator | meaning | dash | bash 5 | bash 3.2 | ksh93 | zsh |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `;;` | stop | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| `;&` | fall through to the next body | **no** | yes | **no** | yes | yes |
| `;;&` | keep testing later patterns | **no** | yes | **no** | **no** | **no** |

`;&` is core; `;;&` is bash-only and belongs to the bash dialect. Lumping
them together as "case extensions" would put a bash-only construct in the
core language.

`;&` is also a **bash 4** feature: bash 3.2 rejects it, so it is
unavailable through macOS's `/bin/sh`. That column only appeared when the
panel gained `bash32`; a four-shell run had reported `;&` as universally
supported outside dash.

## Function definitions

| form | dash | bash | ksh93 | zsh |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `f() { …; }` | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| `function f { …; }` | **no** | yes | yes | yes |
| `function f() { …; }` | **no** | yes | **no** | yes |

The POSIX form is universal. The `function` keyword is core but absent
from dash. The hybrid — keyword *and* parentheses — is rejected by ksh93,
which is where the keyword originated, so it is not core.

A function body is a **compound command**, so it can be any of them, not
only a brace group, and it can carry its own redirections.
