# Pattern matching

One language with three consumers: pathname expansion, `case` patterns,
and the pattern operators of parameter expansion (`#`, `##`, `%`, `%%`,
`/`). Described once here rather than three times, which is why
`parameter-expansion.md` and `expansion.md` both stop short of it.

Citation: POSIX.1-2024 XCU §2.13. Panel measurements as in `../oracle.md`.

## The language is one thing; the restrictions come from the context

This is the fact to hold on to, because the same pattern gives different
answers in different places and the pattern is not what changed:

| probe | result |
| --- | --- |
| `case .hidden in *)` | **matches** |
| glob `*` in a directory holding `.hidden` and `vis` | `vis` only |
| `case a/b in a*b)` | **matches** |
| glob `*f` where the only `f` is `s/f` | no match |

Unanimous. In **pathname expansion** two restrictions apply:

- No metacharacter matches `/`. Patterns are matched one path component
  at a time, so `*` cannot cross a directory boundary.
- No metacharacter matches a **leading** period of a component. Only
  leading: `*.b` matches `a.b`, and `.hid` is matched by `.*id` because
  the period is written explicitly.

In `case` and in parameter expansion neither restriction exists, because
there is no filesystem and no components — the subject is a string.

An implementation that puts these rules in the matcher rather than in the
caller will be wrong in two places out of three.

## The metacharacters

    *        any string, including empty
    ?        any single character
    [ … ]    a bracket expression

Everything else is literal. There is no alternation and no repetition in
the core language, and no way to ask for a longer or shorter match —
`${x#pat}` and `${x##pat}` choose that by doubling the *operator*, not by
anything inside the pattern.

## Bracket expressions

| form | meaning | dash | bash | ksh93 | zsh |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[abc]` | any of those characters | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| `[a-z]` | a range | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| `[!abc]` | none of those | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| `[^abc]` | none of those | **no** | yes | yes | yes |
| `[[:digit:]]` | a character class | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| `[a-]` | a trailing `-` is literal | yes | yes | yes | yes |

**`!` is the portable negation; `^` is an extension** that dash does not
have — there it is an ordinary character, so `[^abc]` matches a literal
`^`, `a`, `b` or `c`. Silent again: the pattern still matches things,
just not the things intended.

Vector field: `BracketCaretNegates` (default true, false for `posix`).

## Quoting decides whether text is a pattern at all

    p='a*b'
    case 'a*b' in  $p ) …    →  matches, as a pattern
    case 'a*b' in "$p") …    →  matches, as a literal
    case  axb  in a\*b) …    →  no match; the star was escaped

Unanimous, and it is the per-span quoting from `tokenization.md` reaching
all the way into matching. A quoted or escaped metacharacter is an
ordinary character, so the matcher has to be told which characters were
quoted — it cannot be handed a plain string.

That is the second requirement the tree carries for this stage, after
`parameter-expansion.md`'s: a pattern is a *word*, not a string.

## Extended patterns are not core

    ?(…)  *(…)  +(…)  @(…)  !(…)

| probe | dash | bash | ksh93 | zsh |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `case abc in @(abc\|xyz))` | error | **error** | `at` | no match |
| `case aaa in +(a))` | error | **error** | `plus` | no match |
| `case b in !(a))` | error | **error** | `not` | no match |

ksh93 has them natively — they are a ksh feature — while bash requires
`shopt -s extglob` and zsh `setopt KSH_GLOB`. Only one panel shell accepts
them as written, so they belong to a dialect and not to the core.

Note the shape of the failures: dash and bash report a **syntax error**,
because `(` is an operator where a pattern was expected, while zsh parses
the pattern and simply does not match. Three behaviors again.

Vector field: `ExtendedPatterns` (default false, true for `ksh`).

## What this does not cover

Collating symbols and equivalence classes (`[[.a.]]`, `[[=a=]]`), which
POSIX defines and which no consumer in this project has needed. Recorded
so their absence is a decision rather than an oversight.
