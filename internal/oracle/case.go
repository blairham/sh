	Script bool

	// SyntaxError marks a case that does not parse **under the bash

		ID: "arith/logical-yields-one-not-an-operand", Category: "arithmetic",
		Snippet: `printf "[%s]" "$((2 && 3))" "$((0 || 5))"`,
		Why:     "a logical operator yields 1 or 0 rather than one of its operands, unlike some languages",
	},

		ID: "arith/short-circuit-is-observable", Category: "arithmetic",
		Snippet: `x=0; printf "[%s]" "$((0 && (x=9)))" "$x"`,
		Why:     "assignment is an operator here, so evaluation order is part of the specification rather than an implementation detail",
	},

		ID: "arith/assignment-escapes", Category: "arithmetic",
		Snippet: `printf "[%s]" "$((x=5))"; printf "[%s]" "$x"`,
		Why:     "an assignment inside an expression is a side effect that outlives it, like ${x:=5}",

		Snippet: `x=1; printf "[%s]" "$((x++))" "$x"`,
		Why:     "++ is not POSIX and dash rejects it",

		ID: "arith/division-by-zero-is-a-runtime-error", Category: "arithmetic",
		Snippet: `printf "[%s]" "$((1/0))"`,
		Why:     "unanimous, and a runtime error rather than a syntax one — the expression parses",
	},
	{
		ID: "arith/non-numeric-variable-diverges", Category: "arithmetic",
		Snippet: `x=abc; printf "[%s]" "$((x+1))"`,
		Why:     "three answers: dash and ksh93 error differently, while bash and zsh re-evaluate the value as an expression and reach 0",

	{
		ID: "cond/no-field-splitting-inside", Category: "conditions",
		Snippet: `x="a b"; [[ $x == "a b" ]] && echo no-splitting`,
		Why:     "[[ ]] is parsed rather than executed, so the words never become arguments and are never split",
	},
	{
		ID: "cond/unset-needs-no-quoting", Category: "conditions",
		Snippet: `unset u; [[ -z $u ]] && echo fine`,
		Why:     "the case where the [ builtin needs its argument quoted and this does not",

		Snippet: `p="a*"; [[ abc == $p ]] && echo var-is-pattern || echo var-is-literal`,
		Why:     "zsh does not treat the result of an expansion as a pattern, which is the glob-expansion-results axis reaching into conditions rather than a second rule",

		Snippet: `[[ 10 -gt 9 ]] && printf numeric; [[ 10 > 9 ]] && printf " string-gt" || printf " string-lt"`,
		Why:     "the sharpest trap in the construct: -gt compares numbers and > compares strings, so 10 sorts before 9",

		Snippet: `[[ abc =~ "^a.c$" ]] && echo still-regex || echo literal`,
		Why:     "bash treats a quoted right operand as a literal string where ksh93 and zsh keep it a regex, so quoting a regex is not portable in either direction",

		Snippet: `[[ ( -n x || -n y ) && ! -z z ]] && echo grouped`,
		Why:     "&& and || join conditions and ( ) groups them rather than starting a subshell, so the parser needs its own production for the inside",

		Snippet: `[[ -n a || -n b && -z x ]] && echo true || echo false`,
		Why:     "inside [[ ]] && binds tighter, as in C; outside it the two share one level, so the same operators have different precedence on either side of the bracket",
